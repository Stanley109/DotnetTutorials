# Dotnet Tutorials
Welcome to my git repository!

The intention of creating this repository is to refresh basic C# concepts and get used to it so that I can apply it to my Selenium Webdriver automation showcase.
I also intend it for others to learn basic C# concepts. As much as possible, I would make each concept simple and concise.

Each folder name will indicate a featured concept in C# that will be used in practice.

Each folder will contain its own runnable program. Just use 'dotnet run' in the current folder to run the specific tutorial.

In the future, I might add Nunit runnable tests. In that case, use 'dotnet test' instead.

Happy learning to all of us!


Cheers!

Jason
